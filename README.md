Shelter is a project in which I did the work of laying out a site consisting of two pages, making it adaptive and interactive.

## Fixed layout of the main and pets pages.
At this stage, work on the fixed layout of two pages has been completed. With a fixed layout, the pages look the same if the window width is at least 1280px.

## Adding layout adaptability.
At this stage, work has been done to adapt the previously created pages according to the layout for different window widths up to 320px inclusive.

## Adding additional functionality.
At this stage, additional functionality has been added to previously made pages: slider, pagination, popup
